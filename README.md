I successfully implemented the design using Next.js 13.4, Tailwind CSS, typecript and various other libraries. Although the Figma design initially did not include a mobile navigation bar, I took the initiative to incorporate one myself. Additionally, I left the dashboard with a text and a route for convenient project navigation.

One of the key achievements of the project is ensuring that the final product is fully responsive on both mobile and desktop devices. This means that users can comfortably access and interact with the application regardless of the device they are using.

By leveraging Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and other libraries, I have created a responsive and user-friendly application that aligns with the original design while making necessary adjustments for a better user experience.
